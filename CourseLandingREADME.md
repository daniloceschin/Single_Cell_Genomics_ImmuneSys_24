## Course overview

Single-cell sequencing technologies are powerful tools used to assess genomic, transcriptomic and proteomics information at the single-cell level. In recent years, the application of techniques that use single-cell sequencing have become increasingly common in several areas of research: including medicine, agriculture, and other life sciences disciplines. Single-cell sequencing may be used to study many aspects of an organism’s biology, both in health and disease, and the results of these studies contribute immensely to advancing the understanding of organisms as a whole. 

Illustrated by the successful formation of scientific networks within the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/biological-networks/), there is growing interest among scientists and increased need for building capacity for single cell technologies. However, there is a lack of infrastructure, limited funding, and expertise  relevant for applying these advanced technologies in Latin America. Therefore, this short course offers hands-on laboratory training and bioinformatics analysis in single-cell technologies to contribute to capacity development in Latin America. 

## Target Audience

Early and mid-career scientists, PhD students, and postdoctoral researchers based in Latin American countries who are engaged or planning to engage in single-cell research.

## Prerequisites

We recommend that participants be familiar with the basics of genomics and molecular Biology. The hands-on bioinformatics modules will be taught using R. Therefore, participants are required to have some familiarity with the R language. This will be essential for participants to fully benefit from the course. All candidates will be requested to undertake pre-course activities to gain the fundamental knowledge needed during the course.

The course will be taught in English but there will be support from Portuguese and Spanish-speaking instructors.

## Course Content

This hands-on laboratory and bioinformatics course will offer a series of lectures and practical sessions including the following topics:

- Introduction to single-cell sequencing: applications and analysis
- Single-cell RNA sequencing methods: detailed state-of-the-art molecular biology protocols for sample preparation
- Hands-on single-cell techniques: from cell preparation to data analysis
- Best practices for planning and executing single-cell experiments, quality control and troubleshooting
- Bioinformatics training: workflows and tools for data processing, visualization, and cellular structure identification 
- Group projects: bioinformatics analyses and grant writing

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course, participants will be able to:

- Compare single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methodologies to identify suitable applications. 
- Plan and perform scRNA-seq laboratory techniques and data analysis to obtain high-quality outputs. 
- Apply R scripting and publicly available data repositories to analyse scRNA-seq data.
- Design and execute a bioinformatics analysis pipeline for scRNA-seq data. 
- Interpret the outcomes of a single-cell RNA-seq pipeline in light of a biological question.
